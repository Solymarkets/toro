# New Website Theme Design

## Overall Aesthetic
The theme will be a blend of rural Japanese aesthetics, inspired by Toro Inoue's world, with a strong emphasis on PS2 era graphics and nostalgic elements. The goal is to create a warm, inviting, and slightly retro atmosphere.

## Color Palette
Based on the generated background image (`toro_room_background.png`) and the old Japanese wood texture (`japanese_wood_card.png`), the following color palette will be used:

*   **Primary Background Color:** A muted, warm beige/light brown, similar to tatami mats and traditional Japanese walls. (e.g., `#D2B48C` - Tan, or a slightly desaturated version)
*   **Accent Colors (for text, borders, and highlights):**
    *   **Dark Brown/Wood Tones:** For structural elements, borders, and text that needs to stand out against lighter backgrounds. (e.g., `#5A4A3C` - Dark Wood, `#8B4513` - SaddleBrown)
    *   **Muted Greens:** Inspired by natural elements like plants or subtle accents in traditional Japanese decor. (e.g., `#8FBC8F` - DarkSeaGreen, or a more desaturated tone)
    *   **Soft Reds/Oranges:** For subtle highlights or interactive elements, reminiscent of traditional Japanese lanterns or accents. (e.g., `#CD5C5C` - IndianRed, `#FFA07A` - LightSalmon)
    *   **Off-White/Cream:** For text and elements on darker backgrounds, providing a soft contrast. (e.g., `#F5F5DC` - Beige, or `#FDF5E6` - OldLace)

## Font
The existing nostalgic PS2 era fonts will be retained to maintain consistency with the user's request.

## Background
The `toro_room_background.png` image will be used as the main background for the entire website, creating an immersive environment of Toro Inoue's traditional Japanese room.

## Card Styles
Sections and content cards will utilize the `japanese_wood_card.png` texture as their background, giving them the appearance of old Japanese wooden panels. Borders and text within these cards will use the defined accent colors to ensure readability and aesthetic coherence.

## Interactive Elements
Interactive elements (buttons, navigation links) will use subtle hover effects and color changes from the defined palette to indicate interactivity, while still adhering to the PS2 era visual style (e.g., pixelated borders on hover, subtle glow effects).

## Overall Visuals
The overall visuals will move away from glowing vibrant colors to a more subdued, natural, and nostalgic feel, aligning with the rural Japanese culture and the PS2 era aesthetic. The existing
