# PS2 Menu Website Theme Design

## Overall Aesthetic
The website will be transformed to emulate the nostalgic look and feel of a PlayStation 2 system menu. This includes a dark, somewhat futuristic, and slightly pixelated aesthetic, with a focus on clear, functional UI elements.

## Color Palette
Based on the PS2 menu references, the following color palette will be used:

*   **Primary Background Color:** Dark charcoal or deep blue-grey, reminiscent of the PS2 system background. (e.g., `#1A1A2E` - Deep Blue-Grey)
*   **Accent Colors (for UI elements, text, and highlights):**
    *   **Light Grey/Off-White:** For primary text and selected menu items, providing high contrast against the dark background. (e.g., `#E0E0E0` - Light Grey)
    *   **Vibrant Blue/Purple:** For active selections, highlights, and interactive elements, reflecting the PS2 logo and memory card colors. (e.g., `#6A0DAD` - Dark Orchid, `#4B0082` - Indigo)
    *   **Subtle Green/Cyan:** For secondary highlights or status indicators, adding a touch of digital glow. (e.g., `#00FFFF` - Cyan, `#00FF7F` - SpringGreen)
    *   **Darker Grey/Black:** For borders, shadows, and subtle depth. (e.g., `#0D0D1A` - Very Dark Blue-Grey)

## Fonts
To achieve the authentic PS2 nostalgic look, pixelated or retro-style fonts will be prioritized. If direct pixel fonts are not feasible for readability, clean, sans-serif fonts with a slightly condensed or blocky appearance will be used, similar to those found in PS2 game menus.

*   **Primary Font:** A pixelated or blocky sans-serif font for headers and prominent text.
*   **Secondary Font:** A clean, readable sans-serif font for body text, ensuring clarity while maintaining the retro vibe.

## Header Design
The header will be redesigned to mimic the PS2 system menu's top bar or title display. It will feature:

*   A prominent, stylized title (e.g., "TORO INOUE" or "SYSTEM MENU") using the primary pixelated font.
*   A clean, minimalist design with clear separation from the main content.
*   Subtle glow or scanline effects to enhance the retro display feel.

## Card Styles
Content cards will adopt a more angular, blocky design, similar to menu windows in PS2 games. They will feature:

*   Solid, dark backgrounds with subtle borders.
*   Clear, contrasting text using the defined color palette.
*   Minimalist design to prioritize content and navigation.

## Background
The background will be a dark, subtle texture or gradient that evokes the PS2 system menu's environment, possibly with faint geometric patterns or a
